Created an Advanced Responsive Pricing Comparison Table using Vanilla JavaScript and SCSS. Uses features like mixins and variables for a highly efficient and organized development process. A build system 'build-css' to effortlessly compile SCSS into CSS. Implemented a toggle button to the pricing comparison table, allowing users to easily switch between monthly and yearly pricing options.
